      "The mechanism of pattern recognition in the brain is\n",
      "little known, and it seems to be almost impossible to\n",
      "reveal it only by conventional physiological experiments. So, we take a slightly different approach to this\n",
      "problem. If we could make a neural network model\n",
      "which has the same capability for pattern recognition\n",
      "as a human being, it would give us a powerful clue to\n",
      "the understanding of the neural mechanism in the\n",
      "brain. In this paper, we discuss how to synthesize a\n",
      "neural network model in order to endow it an ability of\n",
      "pattern recognition like a human being.\n",
      "Several models were proposed with this intention\n",
      "(Rosenblatt, 1962; Kabrisky, 1966; Giebel, 1971;\n",
      "Fukushima, 1975). The response of most of these\n",
      "models, however, was severely affected by the shift in\n",
      "position and/or by the distortion in shape of the input\n",
      "patterns. Hence, their ability for pattern recognition\n",
      "was not so high.\n",
      "In this paper, we propose an improved neural\n",
      "network model. The structure of this network has been\n",
      "suggested by that of the visual nervous system of the\n",
      "vertebrate. This network is self-organized by \"learning\n",
      "without a teacher\", and acquires an ability to recognize\n",
      "stimulus patterns based on the geometrical similarity\n",
      "(Gestalt) of their shapes without affected by their\n",
      "position nor by small distortion of their shapes.\n",
      "This network is given a nickname \"neocognitron\"l,\n",
      "because it is a further extention of the \"cognitron\",\n",
      "which also is a self-organizing multilayered neural\n",
      "network model proposed by the author before\n",
      "(Fukushima, 1975). Incidentally, the conventional\n",
      "cognitron also had an ability to recognize patterns, but\n",
      "its response was dependent upon the position of the\n",
      "stimulus patterns. That is, the same patterns which\n",
      "were presented at different positions were taken as\n",
      "different patterns by the conventional cognitron. In the\n",
      "neocognitron proposed here, however, the response of\n",
      "the network is little affected by the position of the\n",
      "stimulus patterns.\n",
      "1 Preliminary report of the neocognitron already appeared elsewhere (Fukushima, 1979a, b)\n",
      "0340-1200/80/0036/0193/$02.00 \n",
      "194\n",
      "The neocognitron has a multilayered structure, too.\n",
      "It also has an ability of unsupervised learning: We do\n",
      "not need any \"teacher\" during the process of selforganization, and it is only needed to present a set of\n",
      "stimulus patterns repeatedly to the input layer of the\n",
      "network. After completion of self-organization, the\n",
      "network acquires a structure similar to the hierarchy\n",
      "model of the visual nervous system proposed by Hubel\n",
      "and Wiesel (1962, 1965).\n",
      "According to the hierarchy model by Hubel and\n",
      "Wiesel, the neural network in the visual cortex has a\n",
      "hierarchy structure : LGB (lateral geniculate\n",
      "body)--*simple cells-.complex cells~lower order hypercomplex cells--*higher order hypercomplex cells. It\n",
      "is also suggested that the neural network between\n",
      "lower order hypercomplex cells and higher order hypercomplex cells has a structure similar to the network\n",
      "between simple cells and complex cells. In this hierarchy, a cell in a higher stage generally has a tendency\n",
      "to respond selectively to a more complicated feature of\n",
      "the stimulus pattern, and, at the same time, has a larger\n",
      "receptive field, and is more insensitive to the shift in\n",
      "position of the stimulus pattern.\n",
      "It is true that the hierarchy model by Hubel and\n",
      "Wiesel does not hold in its original form. In fact, there\n",
      "are several experimental data contradictory to the\n",
      "hierarchy model, such as monosynaptic connections\n",
      "from LGB to complex cells. This would not, however,\n",
      "completely deny the hierarchy model, if we consider\n",
      "that the hierarchy model represents only the main\n",
      "stream of information flow in the visual system. Hence,\n",
      "a structure similar to the hierarchy model is introduced\n",
      "in our model.\n",
      "Hubel and Wiesel do not tell what kind of cells\n",
      "exist in the stages higher than hypercomplex cells.\n",
      "Some cells in the inferotemporal cortex (i.e. one of the\n",
      "association areas) of the monkey, however, are reported to respond selectively to more specific and more\n",
      "complicated features than hypercomplex cells (for example, triangles, squares, silhouettes of a monkey's\n",
      "hand, etc.), and their responses are scarcely affected by\n",
      "the position or the size of the stimuli (Gross et al.,\n",
      "1972; Sato et al., 1978). These cells might correspond\n",
      "to so-called \"grandmother cells\".\n",
      "Suggested by these physiological data, we extend\n",
      "the hierarchy model of Hubel and Wiesel, and hypothesize the existance of a similar hierarchy structure\n",
      "even in the stages higher than hypercomplex cells. In\n",
      "the extended hierarchy model, the cells in the highest\n",
      "stage are supposed to respond only to specific stimulus\n",
      "patterns without affected by the position or the size of\n",
      "the stimuli.\n",
      "The neocognitron proposed here has such an extended hierarchy structure. After completion of selforganization, the response of the cells of the deepest\n",
      "layer of our network is dependent only upon the shape\n",
      "of the stimulus pattern, and is not affected by the\n",
      "position where the pattern is presented. That is, the\n",
      "network has an ability of position-invariant patternrecognition.\n",
      "In the field of engineering, many methods for\n",
      "pattern recognition have ever been proposed, and\n",
      "several kinds of optical character readers have already\n",
      "been developed. Although such machines are superior\n",
      "to the human being in reading speed, they are far\n",
      "inferior in the ability of correct recognition. Most of\n",
      "the recognition method used for the optical character\n",
      "readers are sensitive to the position of the input\n",

      "the input pattern beforehand. It is very difficult to\n",
      "normalize the position, however, if the input pattern is\n",
      "accompanied with some noise or geometrical distortion. So, it has long been desired to find out an\n",
